# C-Garbage-Collector
 a basic, conservative garbage collector for C programs. Starting from the set of root pointers present in the stack and global variables, we traverse the “object graph” (in the case of malloc, a chunk graph) to find all chunks reachable from the root. These are marked using the third lowest order bit in the size field of each chunk.
